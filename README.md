## 🧠 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing telecom customer data to **predict churn** and identify the key factors driving customer attrition.  
By combining **data analysis, segmentation, and predictive modeling**, it provides insights and actionable strategies to improve customer retention.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Identify patterns that lead to customer churn.  
- Predict churn probability using machine learning models.  
- Segment customers into risk categories.  
- Recommend effective retention actions.  
- Present results through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

## 🧩 Tasks Breakdown

### **Task 1 – Data Preprocessing**
Cleaned and transformed the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and removing inconsistencies to ensure reliable model performance.

### **Task 2 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Analyzed distributions and correlations to uncover key churn trends.  
Discovered that **month-to-month contract** customers and **high monthly charges** are major churn drivers.

### **Task 3 – Customer Segmentation**
Grouped customers based on tenure, payment type, and contract duration to identify loyal, high-risk, and new customers for targeted strategies.

### **Task 4 – Churn Prediction Model**
Implemented and evaluated **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost** models.  
Key churn predictors identified: `ContractType`, `Tenure`, and `MonthlyCharges`.

### **Task 5 – Retention Strategies**
Proposed actionable business strategies:
- Encourage longer contracts via incentives.  
- Promote autopay and credit card payment methods.  
- Offer loyalty programs to long-term customers.  
- Improve service reliability for fiber optic users.

### **Task 6 – Visualization Dashboard**
Developed an **interactive Power BI dashboard** visualizing:
- Churn rates by contract and payment type.  
- Customer segment analysis.  
- Tenure and charge-based churn trends.
